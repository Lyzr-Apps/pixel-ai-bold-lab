Layered nodes are arranged from left to right, connected by glowing lines to represent data flow. Each node layer is labeled: Input, Hidden, Output. Soft gradient circles and playful iconography (lightbulbs, gears, brain) decorate the background, making the concept approachable. The overall mood is bright, modern, and welcoming—ideal for curious beginners.",
